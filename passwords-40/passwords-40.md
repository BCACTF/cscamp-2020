# Problem name (but without the above modifications)
Passwords 4.0
# Problem description
Apparently bit shifting isn't the only binary operation I can use to make things look weird. XORs sound cool...

# Hints
What is XOR?
How do you XOR in Java?
# List of files the player should be allowed to download
Passwords40.java
# Any steps for deployment (compilation instructions, etc.)
Literally nothing, just upload the file. It doesn't even need to be ran.

# Intended solvepath
Possible solve paths:
1. Literally just write the code in reverse
2. Just run the code, stick in the expected output in, and add a print statement
3. Manually XOR each character with ASCII

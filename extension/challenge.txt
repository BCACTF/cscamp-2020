Hint 1: .txt files aren’t the only types of files out there.  If only there were a way to check file types… 
Hint 2: I don’t think this is the right file type.  Is there a way to change it?  Maybe the name of the challenge can help
Files to download: project.txt

Write-Up: It’ll look like a text file, but it’s actually an image (so extension needs to be changed to .png)

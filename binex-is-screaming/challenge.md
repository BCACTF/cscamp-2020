# Name
Binex is Literally Just Screaming

## Description
AAAAA to you too!
It really just is that type of day.
See, I wrote this cool program, but my friend keeps on telling me to not use `gets()` for user input.
Like, what else am I supposed to use?
I'm just feeling very AAAAA!
`nc [url] [port]`

## Hints
* The variable `input` is only 64 characters long. What happens when you send more than that?
* It might not work if you just send one extra character; try a decent bit more than that.

## Compilation
* `gcc src.c -o binex-is-screaming`

## Files
* `src.c`
* `binex-is-screaming`

Put in a large number of "A"s.
I tested it, and it needed 77+, but your mileage may vary.

Problem name: hashtag
Problem Description: Devin the VSCO girl really loves turtles. So he gathered up his scrunchies and his hydro flask for a trip to Sandy Hook Beach to look for them. After all, he really wants to help save them. He found a few turtles washed up on the shore and sat down next to them to make a TikTok. He tagged it with #savetheturtles. The weird thing is, he added another hashtag and put a weird series of letters and numbers next to it. Can you help us figure out what it means?

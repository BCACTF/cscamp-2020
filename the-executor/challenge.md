# Name
The Executor

## Description
You may have seen code before, but your computer can't actually understand that!
To execute instructions, that code has to be *compiled*, which creates a binary executable.
"Binex" is just about finding security holes in these compiled programs.
But before we get ahead of ourselves, let's start simple: just running a program.

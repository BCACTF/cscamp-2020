Problem name: binary
Problem Description: We got a message from aliens last night, but they seem to only speak in 0’s and 1’s. We need an interpreter fast XOR they’ll eat us.
Flag: camp{nom_nom}
Points: 100
Category: Cryptography
Hint 1: XOR?  What’s that?  A typo…? Or maybe something more?
Hint 2: Did you get the XOR? How about we try changing that into a more Standard Code for Information Interchange?
Hint 3: We found a translator but we’re not too sure how to use it. Here, why don’t you give it a try: http://xor.pw/#

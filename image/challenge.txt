Problem name: image
Problem Description: Penelope texted me this image but I can’t help but think there’s something more to it. I tried looking at the image but I don’t see anything wrong with it. Surely Penelope wouldn’t just send me a picture of a flower…
Flag: camp{u5E_7Ex7_eD170rS!}
Points: 50
Category: Forensics
Hint 1: I looked at the image but I couldn’t find anything. Perhaps there’s something inside the image?
Hint 2: Try opening the image in notepad ;)
Hint 3: Still don’t see it? The flag format is the same as usual (camp{}) so you can still use ctrl+f

Write-Up: Open the image with Notepad and use ctrl + f with the keyword “camp” to find the flag (it also happens to be at the bottom of the file)

Scavenger Hunt 5

## Description
You know how to navigate directories, cool.
But can you help me find my flag?
I dropped it in this pretty large `file.txt`.

## Flag
camp{h1dd3n_1n_4_5e4_0f_t3xt}

## Points
250

## Category
Miscellaneous

## Hints
* My friend is telling me that I can `grep` for my flag, but that sounds like a virus to me! I don't want grep throat!
